        <div class="aboutus">
            <p>Faith Christian School, Cainta, Rizal, founded in 1985, is a product of strong faith in God coupled with hard work and dedication of the founder Mrs. Filomena G. Escobido. The school has followed the Lord’s instruction to: “train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”(Proverbs 22:6). Every student was taught about the Bible-“The Living Truth”, and many have come to know the Lord in this institution.
                Many of our graduates have completed tertiary level with flying color. As of March 2014, one member of the alumni graduated as Summa cum laude, 8 members graduated as Magna cum laudes and 38 members graduated Cum laudes from prestigious universities.
                Faith Christian School’s philosophy was developed by studying God’s Word. It contains a system of values, beliefs, and discipline based on the Lord Jesus Christ as He is revealed in the Scriptures. It is one that follows after Christ because in Christ, “hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”(Colossians 2:3)
                Therefore, FCS adopts a Christian philosophy of education that calls for an educational process that puts the Bible at the center and asks the student and the teacher to evaluate all they see in the world through the eyes of God-because God is truth (Kienel, 1974).</p>
